 ------ Game plot -----------<br>
 You are stranded on an island, far away from any other humans.<br>
 While you are wandering around the small land in the middle of the ocean, you spot a dead monk laying on the ground,<br>
 with a knife sticking in his chest.<br>
 <br>
 Strong as you are, you walk up to him and pull it out, but then huge flies start appearing all around you,<br>
 and you have to fight them, to in the end get the trophy you deserve.<br>
